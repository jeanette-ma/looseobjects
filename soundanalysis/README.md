# Sound Analysis

Small project to try to come up with a sound analysis technique that can detect the sound of falling bolts.

The main output of this project is a notebook file with the scripts used to analyse and, if possible, to detect loosen bolts.

## Dependencies

This project uses the project `librosa`. But, since `librosa` uses `numba`, at the moment it requires `numpy` version < 1.24 in order to run.
